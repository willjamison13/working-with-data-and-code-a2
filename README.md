## General info
This project recreates and animates the LA28 Olympic logo using Processing.py (Python Mode).
It explores how coded motion and sequencing can communicate design concepts visually.
The aim was to develop creative code literacy — understanding how programming structures like loops, functions, and variables can be used artistically to produce animated outcomes.
	
## Technologies
* Project is created with:
* Processing.py (Python Mode for Processing)
* Python syntax and logic for animation control
* Coordinate geometry for shape drawing
* Color lists and layering for the Olympic palette
* Frame-based sequencing for animation timing

## Setup
1. Open the .pyde file in Processing (Python Mode).
2. Click Run ▶️ to start the animation.
3. The animation will:
	* Draw the “L” first
	* Animate the “A” with three layered colors
	* Reveal the five Olympic rings in sequence
4. The sequence automatically loops once complete
